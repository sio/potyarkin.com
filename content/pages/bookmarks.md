- [Notes on the small web](https://felix.plesoianu.ro/web/in-the-small.html) -
  There still exists a web like the one I browsed when I was a teenager. It's
  just not as visible anymore with all the loud giants grabbing most of
  attention first.


## May 2022

- **[Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/)** -
  Remember when you used to explore the Internet, when you used to discover
  cool little websites made by people and it wasn't just a bunch of low effort
  content mill listicles and blog spam? I want to show you that the Internet
  you used to go exploring is still very much there. There are still tons of
  small personal websites, and a wealth of long form text from both the past
  and the present. So it's a search engine. It's perhaps not the greatest at
  finding what you already knew was there. Instead it is designed to help you
  find some things you didn't even know you were looking for.
- [Beej's Guide to Unix IPC](https://beej.us/guide/bgipc/html/multi/index.html) -

  realm of IPC by delivering a concise overview of various IPC techniques. This
  is not the definitive set of documents that cover this subject, by any means.
  Like I said, it is designed to simply give you a foothold in this, the
  exciting world of IPC.
- [Google Chrome loses all saved passwords on Linux](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1251355) -
  a bug from 2021 that affects about 5% of Linux Chrome installations.
  Password sync errors out when it encounters just one mangled row in SQLite
  database. Check if you're affected by this error: <chrome://sync-internals/>
  (look for red/green row for 'Passwords' on the right side of screen),
  workaround: enable <chrome://flags/#clean-undecryptable-passwords>, then
  toggle sync off/on.
- [Science Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness](https://www.smbc-comics.com/covid/files/miniSciWebv6.pdf) -
  Aristotle said a bunch of stuff that was wrong. Galileo and Newton fixed
  things up. Then Einstein broke everything again. Now, we’ve basically got it
  all worked out, except for small stuff, big stuff, hot stuff, cold stuff,
  fast stuff, heavy stuff, dark stuff, turbulence, and the concept of time.
