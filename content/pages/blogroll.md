## Linux

  - **[Wandering Thoughts](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/) by Chris
    Siebenmann at University of Toronto**

    Fifteen years of almost daily articles on Unix/Linux and Python. Very
    interesting findings on Unix history from a person who had experienced most
    of it firsthand. Some less important news, scripts and philosophical musings
    on the role of software in our lives.

    The author hosts his blog at employer's hosting and domain name, so I
    wouldn't be surprised if the blog would go offline one day. Let's hope the
    Web Archive runs its spiders regularly.

  - **[Drew DeVault's Blog](https://drewdevault.com/)**

    Personal tech blog from the creator of Sourcehut, a more transparent
    alternative to GitHub.  Drew writes about being an entrepreneur in the FOSS
    world, about sustainability of Open Source projects and about tricky
    problems he uses Unix and Python knowledge to solve.

  - **[unixsheikh.com](http://unixsheikh.com/)**

    Personal blog of old school Unix sysadmin. Pretty opinionated and
    anti-establishment. Many good articles on OpenBSD, networking/firewalling,
    ZFS vs other storage solutions, etc.

  - **[Kushal Das' Blog](https://kushaldas.in/)**

    Tech blog from a Red Hat employee, Python contributor and Fedora developer.
    Good articles on India FOSS scene, managing a LUG, privacy and security.

  - **[Xe Iaso (Christine Dodrill)](https://xeiaso.net/blog)**

    NixOS and k8s in a homelab. Some deployment walkthroughs, some high-level
    overviews of tech concepts - all in a monospace font with anime characters
    in sidebars.


## Homelab

  - **[blog.kroy.io](https://blog.kroy.io/)**

    Homelab enthusiast with a lot of informative writeups on hypervisors,
    automation and routing. Lots of routing! BGP, VyOS, router benchmarks - the
    fun stuff!

  - **[OXcrag.net](https://oxcrag.net/)**

    A homelabber with view similar to mine: prefers plain Ubuntu/KVM to Proxmox,
    uses Backblaze B2, builds routers from scratch with nftables...

  - **[Blogging to Nowhere](https://webworxshop.com/) by Rob Connoly**

    First-person view of selfhosted obsession. Ansible, GitLab CI, Docker... All
    the good stuff.

  - **[Defend the planet](https://defendtheplanet.net)**

    Tinkering with ARM single-board computers, learning to solder, designing
    robots, building Docker swarms and repairing Volkswagen T4. Cool blog.

  - **[JankScale Datasystems](https://blog.jankscale.com/)**

    Personal datacenter in a metal container in a backyard. There will probably
    be some interesting posts on IaC (implied by author's reddit flair)

  - **[Just another Linux geek](https://blog.christophersmart.com)**

    Maintaining automatable homelab with Ansible, libvirt/KVM and Fedora. Some
    OpenWRT sprinkled here and there.

  - **[YetiOps](https://yetiops.net/posts/)**

    Homelab, Ansible, KVM, Terraform, Pulumi

  - **[Adventurist Blog](https://adventurist.me/page/1) by Tom Jones**

    FreeBSD, electronics engineering, hacker camps and fests. Using serial
    console for out-of-band server management (whitebox builds)


## OpenBSD

  - **[Sol√®ne Rapenne](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/)**

    OpenBSD developer solene@. Also some posts on NixOS, reproducible builds,
    game engines...

  - **[Doing stupid things (with packets and OpenBSD)](https://doing-stupid-things.as59645.net/)**

    Sometimes, it is fun to do stupid things. This blog documents things done on
    AS59645 to run a (mostly) OpenBSD only, self-hosted AS "the old way". Most
    certainly NSFP (Not Safe for Production) and never reasonable.


## Other IT related topics

  - **[Data, tech, and sometimes Nutella](https://veekaybee.github.io/) by Vicky
    Boykis**

    Some social insights into IT industry, articles about privacy in modern
    world. Lots of links to Hacker News, Reddit trends, some posts about
    Facebook, some posts about Python.

  - **[/dev/lawyer](https://writing.kemitchell.com/) by Kyle E. Mitchell**

    A blog by a lawyer very knowledgeable of open source licenses. Kyle has
    written several niche licenses that try to be better than the existing FOSS
    ones. The blog is frequently updated with articles on open source
    sustainability, free work and profiteering by industry from FOSS
    contributors. There are also links to other blogs in the same field.

  - **[The Webb Blog](https://blog.webb.page/) by Paul Anthony Webb**

    This author has an opinion on how the currently broken Internet can be
    fixed. Let's see what happens...

    A brilliant technologist and a good conference speaker who worked at Sun and
    Joyent (SmartOS), and now have founded a new startup (Oxide). Other blogs at
    DTrace.org are updated less frequently but usually are also interesting.

    Essays of a westerner living in China. Unexpected sides of Chinese and
    generally non-Western politics and economics. A lot of book reviews
    (non-fiction).
