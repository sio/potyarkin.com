  - title: On github as a social network
    by: Eric Bower
    url: https://erock.io/2022/06/03/github-as-social-network.html
    description: |-
      Why do I get so excited when I receive stars on my projects hosted on
      github? I am constantly trying to come up with new projects to build, but
      do I actually want to build them? Or do I just want social currency? I’m
      not sure I can tell the difference anymore.

      Github isn’t just a code repository, it’s a social networking site.

      "Idle chitchat" vs "smalltalk"
    url: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31880345
    description: |-
      It took me probably 7 years after moving out of my parent’s place to
      learn that “smalltalk” and “idle chitchat” are not necessarily the same
      thing [...]

      In my taxonomy, “idle chitchat” is talking about things. “Smalltalk” is
      learning about each other. “The weather sure is nice today, isn’t it?” =>
      idle chitchat. You’re not likely to understand a person from that
      starting point, except that “wow look, we both like the sun”. “Where are
      you from? What brings you here?” => smalltalk. You’re encouraging the
      person to reveal some small amounts of information about themselves which
      you can use to probe further and hopefully find something fascinating [...]

      Now I take conversations with strangers (or anyone really) as a sport, as
      a challenge. “How can I use these precious moments we strangers share to
      discover something new? To leave one of us pondering something novel
      later in the evening” [...]

  - title: 13 Propositions on an Internet for a “Burning World”
    url: https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3390006_1/component/file_3390007/content
    description: |-
      However, up until then, we live in a burning world, i.e., one evaporating
      under the human-made climate emergency and countless other shifts we find
      ourselves in at the moment. The Internet of today will certainly neither
      be sustainable nor resilient in the future we are heading towards.

      Tobias Fiebig and Doris Aschenbrenner wrote down these
      thoughts in a paper in the form of “13 propositions”, which will appear
      in the proceedings of the joint workshops on “Technologies, Applications,
      and Uses of a Responsible Internet” and “Building Greener Internet”.

      Internet you used to go exploring is still very much there. There are
      still tons of small personal websites, and a wealth of long form text
      from both the past and the present. So it's a search engine. It's perhaps
      not the greatest at finding what you already knew was there. Instead it
      is designed to help you find some things you didn't even know you were
