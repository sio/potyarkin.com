title: Roads and Bridges - sustaining modern digital infrastructure

This week I have stumbled upon a very thorough review of existing problems and
hidden costs of sustaining modern (open source) digital infrastructure. Here it
is: [Roads and Bridges - The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital
Infrastructure][original] by *Nadia Eghbal*.

The essay was created with support from the Ford Foundation and is published on
their website under a Creative Commons license. Unfortunately, that website
denies access to users from certain countries (like Russia), so here is a
[mirror of PDF version][mirror].

The author discusses important and often overlooked topics of why open source
software gets built and by whom, of who pays the costs of building and
maintaining that software and of how to ensure that the software we all rely
upon continues to be *reliable*. The essay poses more questions than it
answers, but I still consider it the best read on the topic of sustaining open
source development.

In my case Nadia Eghbal was "preaching to the converted" so this post is me
trying to spread her word. Please read her essay and please do not take open
source software for granted. The costs of building it are just payed by others,
may be you can figure out how to help them?
