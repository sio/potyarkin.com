    - Disposable servers, configuration drift, snowflake servers
    - Immutable infrastructure - that's a bit too far ahead for me now

    - Why copy shell and cli configs? You ain't gonna use them

- Not sure about Ansible Galaxy, you would still need to read it all to trust.
  And minor tweaks are almost always required.
