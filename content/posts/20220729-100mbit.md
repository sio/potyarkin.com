title: Negotiating down to 100Mbit between two 1Gbit devices

Connecting two gigabit-capable devices via 4-wire UTP cable is an abomination,
but sometimes we have to live with it (e.g. when a [greedy ISP]
decides to save a few cents and pulls a cheap cable to your apartment).

The fun starts when these devices try to negotiate Ethernet connection speed.
[Autonegotiation pulses] are essentially 10BASE-T and use only 4 wires with no
checking of cable category, even CAT3 is enough. So autonegotiation will
"successfully" settle on 1Gbit though there is not enough physical conductors
for it. The link will not work.

To negotiate a working connection instead we need to remove 1Gbit from
advertised link modes at least on one end. In Linux it should be rather
straightforward with [ethtool]:

```
$ ethtool -s $IFACE advertise 0x00f
```

0x00f is a sum of hex values for all 10Mbit and 100Mbit modes
(0x001 + 0x002 + 0x004 + 0x008) which does not include 1Gbit or anything
above that. Tweaking advertised link modes is better than forcing a particular
connection speed (`ethtool -s $IFACE speed 100`) because in absence of
autonegotiation advertisement the other side may play it safe and switch
to half-duplex.

That's the theory. In practise, hardware is difficult. Drivers for NICs are
tricky and sometimes incomplete. On D-Link DIR-825 changes made by ethtool
command did not stick: after a short hiccup NIC would immediately return back
to default settings, ignoring ethtool input completely.

But all is not lost. Through trial and error I found a sequence that worked.
Don't ask me why, I'm not cool enough yet to understand kernel drivers code.
Here is what worked for me:

```
# Excerpt from /etc/rc.local
# (order of commands and delays matter!)
WAN=eth1
ethtool -s $WAN autoneg off
sleep 1
ethtool -s $WAN speed 100
sleep 1
ethtool -s $WAN advertise 0x00f
```

Which results in a proper NIC configuration:

```

                        100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full

```

Let's hope some variation of this will work for your misbehaving device too!
Good luck!
