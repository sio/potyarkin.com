My native language is not English and since my first encounter with computers I
have used multiple localized and non-localized computer programs. And all these
years of *"user experience"* have led me to believe that software localization
is more often harmful than not.

Software translation is a waste of time. Generally.

I am not against localization as a whole. It has many positive aspects like
supporting foreign date and currency formats, right-to-left writing or
alphabetical sorting. But translating user interface, configuration files,
error and log messages to other languages had destructive consequences most of
the times I've seen it.

## Documentation loss

The moment software is translated its documentation becomes fragmented and
incomplete. Even if the developer translates 100% of official documentation
they will still lose everything written by others.

I was twelve when a friend of mine gave me a book on photo editing. The authors
explained how images are stored on computers, what is the difference between
raster and vector graphics, but it was mostly centered on using Adobe Photoshop
- version 7.0, if I recall correctly. And that was one large useless book.
Because the authors used the English version of that editor and all we've had
was the translated one.

You might think it was a mistake on the authors's part, but they were smart and
experienced people. They knew it was pointless referencing a translated version
because no professional user would have used Russian interface at that time.
And they knew that the next version might come with totally different
translation for the same UI elements.

## Waste of resources

If you are not sure you can afford a good translation, don't do one. I can not
stress enough how confusing it is to have a piece of software that uses your
native language, and not to be able to understand the meaning of its messages
without translating them back to English first. This happens all the time when
software is translated by people who do not use it daily and do not understand
all the usecases there are.

I took part in translation of an open source program once. I was a student and
I've had a lot of free time, so I thought I could do some good and contribute
back to the software I thought was worthy.

## Untranslatable abstractions
## Lost in translation
