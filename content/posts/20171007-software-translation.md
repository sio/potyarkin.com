My native language is not English and since my first encounter with computers
I have used multiple localized and non-localized computer programs. And all these
years of *"user experience"* have led me to believe that software localization
is more often harmful than not.

Software translation is a waste of time. Generally.

I am not against localization as a whole. It has so many positive aspects like
supporting foreign date and currency formats, right-to-left writing or
alphabetical sorting. But translating user interface, configuration files, error
and log messages to other languages had destructive consequences most of the
times I've seen it.
