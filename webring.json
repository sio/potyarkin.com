However, despite their\nparallel rise in computing, these two domains remain philosophically distant.</p>\n<p>Though some audaciously-named companies might suggest otherwise, the machine\nlearning space has enjoyed almost none of the freedoms forwarded by the free and\nopen source software movement. Much of the actual code related to machine\nlearning is publicly available, and there are many public access research\npapers available for anyone to read. However, the key to machine learning is\naccess to a high-quality dataset and heaps of computing power to process that\ndata, and these two resources are still kept under lock and key by almost all\nparticipants in the space.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The essential barrier to entry for machine learning projects is overcoming these\ntwo problems, which are often very costly to secure. A high-quality, well tagged\ndata set generally requires thousands of hours of labor to produce,<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fn:2\">2</a></sup> a task\nwhich can potentially cost millions of dollars. Any approach which lowers this\nfigure is thus very desirable, even if the cost is making ethical compromises.\nWith Amazon, it takes the form of gig economy exploitation. With GitHub, it\ntakes the form of disregarding the terms of free software licenses. In the\nprocess, they built a tool which facilitates the large-scale laundering of free\nsoftware into non-free software by their customers, who GitHub offers plausible\ndeniability through an inscrutable algorithm.</p>\n<p>Free software is not an unqualified gift. There are terms for its use and\nre-use. Even so-called &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; software licenses impose requirements on\nre-use, such as attribution. To quote the MIT license:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted [&hellip;] subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or the equally &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; BSD license:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p>Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, copyleft licenses such as GNU General Public\nLicense or Mozilla Public License go further, demanding not only attribution for\nderivative works, but that such derived works are <em>also released</em> with the same\nlicense. Quoting GPL:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it\nfrom the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n<p>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\ncomes into possession of a copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And MPL:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\nterms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they\ncan obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Free software licenses impose obligations on the user through terms governing\nattribution, sublicensing, distribution, patents, trademarks, and relationships\nwith laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The free software community\nis no stranger to the difficulties in enforcing compliance with these\nobligations, which some groups view as too onerous. But as onerous as one may\nview these obligations to be, one is nevertheless required to comply with them.\nIf you believe that the force of copyright should protect your proprietary\nsoftware, then you must agree that it equally protects open source works,\ndespite the inconvenience or cost associated with this truth.</p>\n<p>GitHub&rsquo;s Copilot is trained on software governed by these terms, and it fails to\nuphold them, and enables customers to accidentally fail to uphold these terms\nthemselves. Some argue about the risks of a &ldquo;copyleft surprise&rdquo;, wherein someone\nincorporates a GPL licensed work into their product and is surprised to find\nthat they are obligated to release their product under the terms of the GPL as\nwell. Copilot institutionalizes this risk and any user who wishes to use it to\ndevelop non-free software would be well-advised not to do so, else they may find\nthemselves legally liable to uphold these terms, perhaps ultimately being\nrequired to release their works under the terms of a license which is\nundesirable for their goals.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the argument comes down to whether or not the model constitutes a\nderivative work of its inputs. Microsoft argues that it does not. However, these\nlicenses are not specific regarding the means of derivation; the classic\napproach of copying and pasting from one project to another need not be the only\nmeans for these terms to apply. The model exists as the result of applying an\nalgorithm to these inputs, and thus the model itself is a derivative work of its\ninputs. The model, then used to create new programs, forwards its obligations to\nthose works.</p>\n<p>All of this assumes the best interpretation of Microsoft&rsquo;s argument, with a\nheavy reliance on the fact that the model becomes a general purpose programmer,\nhaving meaningfully learned from its inputs and applying this knowledge to\nproduce original work. Should a human programmer take the same approach,\nstudying free software and applying those lessons, but not the code itself, to\noriginal projects, I would agree that their applied knowledge is not creating\nderivative works. However, that is not how machine learning works. Machine\nlearning is essentially a glorified pattern recognition and reproduction engine,\nand does not represent a genuine generalization of the learning process. It is\nperhaps capable of a limited amount of originality, but is also capable of\ndegrading to the simple case of copy and paste. Here is an example of Copilot\nreproducing, verbatim, a function which is governed by the GPL, and would thus\nbe governed by its terms:</p>\n<p><video controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://mirror.drewdevault.com/copilot-squareroot.mp4\"></video></p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309\">\n    Armin Ronacher</a> via Twitter\n  </small>\n</div>\n<p>The license reproduced by Copilot is not correct, neither in form nor function.\nThis code was not written by V. Petkov and the GPL imposes much stronger\nobligations than those suggested by the comment. This small example was\ndeliberately provoked with a suggestive prompt (this famous function is known as\nthe &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root\">fast inverse square root</a>&quot;) and the &ldquo;float Q_&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not a stretch to\nassume someone can accidentally do something similar with any particularly\nunlucky English-language description of their goal.</p>\n<p>Of course, the use of a suggestive prompt to convince Copilot to print GPL\nlicensed code suggests another use: deliberately laundering FOSS source code. If\nMicrosoft&rsquo;s argument holds, then indeed the only thing which is necessary to\nlegally circumvent a free software license is to teach a machine learning\nalgorithm to regurgitate a function you want to use.</p>\n<p>This is a problem. I have two suggestions to offer to two audiences: one for\nGitHub, and another for free software developers who are worried about Copilot.</p>\n<p>To GitHub: this is your Oracle v Google moment. You&rsquo;ve invested in building a\nplatform on top of which the open source revolution was built, and leveraging\nthis platform for this move is a deep betrayal of the community&rsquo;s trust. The law\napplies to you, and banking on the fact that the decentralized open source\ncommunity will not be able to mount an effective legal challenge to your $7.5B\nMicrosoft war chest does not change this. The open source community is\nastonished, and the astonishment is slowly but surely boiling over into rage as\nour concerns fall on deaf ears and you push forward with the Copilot release. I\nexpect that if the situation does not change, you will find a group motivated\nenough to challenge this. The legitimacy of the free software ecosystem may rest\non this problem, and there are many companies who are financially incentivized\nto see to it that this legitimacy stands. I am certainly prepared to join a\nclass action lawsuit as a maintainer, or alongside other companies with\ninterests in free software making use of our financial resources to facilitate a\nlawsuit.</p>\n<p>The tool can be improved, probably still in time to avoid the most harmful\neffects (harmful to your business, that is) of Copilot. I offer the following\nspecific suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allow GitHub users and repositories to opt-out of being incorporated into the\nmodel. Better, allow them to opt-in. Do not tie this flag into unrelated\nprojects like Software Heritage and the Internet Archive.</li>\n<li>Track the software licenses which are incorporated into the model and inform\nusers of their obligations with respect to those licenses.</li>\n<li>Remove copyleft code from the model entirely, unless you want to make the\nmodel and its support code free software as well.</li>\n<li>Consider compensating the copyright owners of free software projects\nincorporated into the model with a margin from the Copilot usage fees, in\nexchange for a license permitting this use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your current model probably needs to be thrown out. The GPL code incorporated\ninto it entitles anyone who uses it to receive a GPL&rsquo;d copy of the model for\ntheir own use. It entitles these people to commercial use, to build a competing\nproduct with it. But, it presumably also includes works under incompatible\nlicenses, such as the CDDL, which is&hellip; problematic. The whole thing is a legal\nmess.</p>\n<p>I cannot speak for the rest of the community that have been hurt by this\nproject, but for my part, I would be okay with not pursuing the answers to any\nof these questions with you in court if you agreed to resolve these problems\nnow.</p>\n<p>And, my advice to free software maintainers who are pissed that their licenses\nare being ignored. First, don&rsquo;t use GitHub and your code will not make it into\nthe model (for now). <a href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2022/03/29/free-software-free-infrastructure.html\">I&rsquo;ve written before</a> about why it&rsquo;s generally important\nfor free software projects to use free software infrastructure, and this only\nre-enforces that fact. Furthermore, the old &ldquo;vote with your wallet&rdquo; approach is\na good way to show your disfavor. That said, if it occurs to you that you\n<em>don&rsquo;t</em> actually pay for GitHub, then you may want to take a moment to consider\nif the incentives created by that relationship explain this development and may\nlead to more unfavorable outcomes for you in the future.</p>\n<p>You may also be tempted to solve this problem by changing your software licenses\nto prohibit this behavior. I&rsquo;ll say upfront that according to Microsoft&rsquo;s\ninterpretation of the situation (invoking fair use), it doesn&rsquo;t matter to them\nwhich license you use: they&rsquo;ll use your code regardless. In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGr93091552/status/1539731632931803137\">some\nproprietary code</a> was found to have been incorporated into the model. However, I\nstill support your efforts to address this in your software licenses, as it\nprovides an even stronger legal foundation upon which we can reject Copilot.</p>\n<p>I will caution you that the way you approach that clause of your license is\nimportant. Whenever writing or changing a free and open source software license,\nyou should consider whether or not it will still qualify as free or open source\nafter your changes. To be specific, a clause which outright forbids the use of\nyour code for training a machine learning model will make your software\n<em>non-free</em>, and I do not recommend this approach. Instead, I would update your\nlicenses to clarify that incorporating the code into a machine learning model is\nconsidered a form of derived work, and that your license terms apply to the\nmodel and any works produced with that model.</p>\n<p>To summarize, I think that GitHub Copilot is a bad idea as designed. It\nrepresents a flagrant disregard of FOSS licensing in of itself, and it enables\nsimilar disregard — deliberate or otherwise — among its users. I\nhope they will heed my suggestions, and I hope that my words to the free\nsoftware community offer some concrete ways to move forward with this problem.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Shout-out to Mozilla Common Voice, one of the few exceptions to this rule,\nwhich is an excellent project that has produced a high-quality, freely\navailable dataset of voice samples, and used it to develop free models and\nsoftware for text-to-speech and speech recognition. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fnref:1\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>Typically exploitative labor from low-development countries which the tech\nindustry often pretends isn&rsquo;t a hair&rsquo;s breadth away from slavery. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fnref:2\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",

However, the key to machine learning is\naccess to a high-quality dataset and heaps of computing power to process that\ndata, and these two resources are still kept under lock and key by almost all\nparticipants in the space.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The essential barrier to entry for machine learning projects is overcoming these\ntwo problems, which are often very costly to secure. A high-quality, well tagged\ndata set generally requires thousands of hours of labor to produce,<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fn:2\">2</a></sup> a task\nwhich can potentially cost millions of dollars. Any approach which lowers this\nfigure is thus very desirable, even if the cost is making ethical compromises.\nWith Amazon, it takes the form of gig economy exploitation. With GitHub, it\ntakes the form of disregarding the terms of free software licenses. In the\nprocess, they built a tool which facilitates the large-scale laundering of free\nsoftware into non-free software by their customers, who GitHub offers plausible\ndeniability through an inscrutable algorithm.</p>\n<p>Free software is not an unqualified gift. There are terms for its use and\nre-use. Even so-called &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; software licenses impose requirements on\nre-use, such as attribution. To quote the MIT license:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted [&hellip;] subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or the equally &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; BSD license:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p>Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, copyleft licenses such as GNU General Public\nLicense or Mozilla Public License go further, demanding not only attribution for\nderivative works, but that such derived works are <em>also released</em> with the same\nlicense. Quoting GPL:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it\nfrom the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n<p>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\ncomes into possession of a copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And MPL:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\nterms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they\ncan obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Free software licenses impose obligations on the user through terms governing\nattribution, sublicensing, distribution, patents, trademarks, and relationships\nwith laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The free software community\nis no stranger to the difficulties in enforcing compliance with these\nobligations, which some groups view as too onerous. But as onerous as one may\nview these obligations to be, one is nevertheless required to comply with them.\nIf you believe that the force of copyright should protect your proprietary\nsoftware, then you must agree that it equally protects open source works,\ndespite the inconvenience or cost associated with this truth.</p>\n<p>GitHub&rsquo;s Copilot is trained on software governed by these terms, and it fails to\nuphold them, and enables customers to accidentally fail to uphold these terms\nthemselves. Some argue about the risks of a &ldquo;copyleft surprise&rdquo;, wherein someone\nincorporates a GPL licensed work into their product and is surprised to find\nthat they are obligated to release their product under the terms of the GPL as\nwell. Copilot institutionalizes this risk and any user who wishes to use it to\ndevelop non-free software would be well-advised not to do so, else they may find\nthemselves legally liable to uphold these terms, perhaps ultimately being\nrequired to release their works under the terms of a license which is\nundesirable for their goals.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the argument comes down to whether or not the model constitutes a\nderivative work of its inputs. Microsoft argues that it does not. However, these\nlicenses are not specific regarding the means of derivation; the classic\napproach of copying and pasting from one project to another need not be the only\nmeans for these terms to apply. The model exists as the result of applying an\nalgorithm to these inputs, and thus the model itself is a derivative work of its\ninputs. The model, then used to create new programs, forwards its obligations to\nthose works.</p>\n<p>All of this assumes the best interpretation of Microsoft&rsquo;s argument, with a\nheavy reliance on the fact that the model becomes a general purpose programmer,\nhaving meaningfully learned from its inputs and applying this knowledge to\nproduce original work. Should a human programmer take the same approach,\nstudying free software and applying those lessons, but not the code itself, to\noriginal projects, I would agree that their applied knowledge is not creating\nderivative works. However, that is not how machine learning works. Machine\nlearning is essentially a glorified pattern recognition and reproduction engine,\nand does not represent a genuine generalization of the learning process. It is\nperhaps capable of a limited amount of originality, but is also capable of\ndegrading to the simple case of copy and paste. Here is an example of Copilot\nreproducing, verbatim, a function which is governed by the GPL, and would thus\nbe governed by its terms:</p>\n<p><video controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://mirror.drewdevault.com/copilot-squareroot.mp4\"></video></p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309\">\n    Armin Ronacher</a> via Twitter\n  </small>\n</div>\n<p>The license reproduced by Copilot is not correct, neither in form nor function.\nThis code was not written by V. Petkov and the GPL imposes much stronger\nobligations than those suggested by the comment. This small example was\ndeliberately provoked with a suggestive prompt (this famous function is known as\nthe &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root\">fast inverse square root</a>&quot;) and the &ldquo;float Q_&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not a stretch to\nassume someone can accidentally do something similar with any particularly\nunlucky English-language description of their goal.</p>\n<p>Of course, the use of a suggestive prompt to convince Copilot to print GPL\nlicensed code suggests another use: deliberately laundering FOSS source code. If\nMicrosoft&rsquo;s argument holds, then indeed the only thing which is necessary to\nlegally circumvent a free software license is to teach a machine learning\nalgorithm to regurgitate a function you want to use.</p>\n<p>This is a problem. I have two suggestions to offer to two audiences: one for\nGitHub, and another for free software developers who are worried about Copilot.</p>\n<p>To GitHub: this is your Oracle v Google moment. You&rsquo;ve invested in building a\nplatform on top of which the open source revolution was built, and leveraging\nthis platform for this move is a deep betrayal of the community&rsquo;s trust. The law\napplies to you, and banking on the fact that the decentralized open source\ncommunity will not be able to mount an effective legal challenge to your $7.5B\nMicrosoft war chest does not change this. The open source community is\nastonished, and the astonishment is slowly but surely boiling over into rage as\nour concerns fall on deaf ears and you push forward with the Copilot release. I\nexpect that if the situation does not change, you will find a group motivated\nenough to challenge this. The legitimacy of the free software ecosystem may rest\non this problem, and there are many companies who are financially incentivized\nto see to it that this legitimacy stands. I am certainly prepared to join a\nclass action lawsuit as a maintainer, or alongside other companies with\ninterests in free software making use of our financial resources to facilitate a\nlawsuit.</p>\n<p>The tool can be improved, probably still in time to avoid the most harmful\neffects (harmful to your business, that is) of Copilot. I offer the following\nspecific suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allow GitHub users and repositories to opt-out of being incorporated into the\nmodel. Better, allow them to opt-in. Do not tie this flag into unrelated\nprojects like Software Heritage and the Internet Archive.</li>\n<li>Track the software licenses which are incorporated into the model and inform\nusers of their obligations with respect to those licenses.</li>\n<li>Remove copyleft code from the model entirely, unless you want to make the\nmodel and its support code free software as well.</li>\n<li>Consider compensating the copyright owners of free software projects\nincorporated into the model with a margin from the Copilot usage fees, in\nexchange for a license permitting this use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your current model probably needs to be thrown out. The GPL code incorporated\ninto it entitles anyone who uses it to receive a GPL&rsquo;d copy of the model for\ntheir own use. It entitles these people to commercial use, to build a competing\nproduct with it. But, it presumably also includes works under incompatible\nlicenses, such as the CDDL, which is&hellip; problematic. The whole thing is a legal\nmess.</p>\n<p>I cannot speak for the rest of the community that have been hurt by this\nproject, but for my part, I would be okay with not pursuing the answers to any\nof these questions with you in court if you agreed to resolve these problems\nnow.</p>\n<p>And, my advice to free software maintainers who are pissed that their licenses\nare being ignored. First, don&rsquo;t use GitHub and your code will not make it into\nthe model (for now). <a href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2022/03/29/free-software-free-infrastructure.html\">I&rsquo;ve written before</a> about why it&rsquo;s generally important\nfor free software projects to use free software infrastructure, and this only\nre-enforces that fact. Furthermore, the old &ldquo;vote with your wallet&rdquo; approach is\na good way to show your disfavor. That said, if it occurs to you that you\n<em>don&rsquo;t</em> actually pay for GitHub, then you may want to take a moment to consider\nif the incentives created by that relationship explain this development and may\nlead to more unfavorable outcomes for you in the future.</p>\n<p>You may also be tempted to solve this problem by changing your software licenses\nto prohibit this behavior. I&rsquo;ll say upfront that according to Microsoft&rsquo;s\ninterpretation of the situation (invoking fair use), it doesn&rsquo;t matter to them\nwhich license you use: they&rsquo;ll use your code regardless. In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGr93091552/status/1539731632931803137\">some\nproprietary code</a> was found to have been incorporated into the model. However, I\nstill support your efforts to address this in your software licenses, as it\nprovides an even stronger legal foundation upon which we can reject Copilot.</p>\n<p>I will caution you that the way you approach that clause of your license is\nimportant. Whenever writing or changing a free and open source software license,\nyou should consider whether or not it will still qualify as free or open source\nafter your changes. To be specific, a clause which outright forbids the use of\nyour code for training a machine learning model will make your software\n<em>non-free</em>, and I do not recommend this approach. Instead, I would update your\nlicenses to clarify that incorporating the code into a machine learning model is\nconsidered a form of derived work, and that your license terms apply to the\nmodel and any works produced with that model.</p>\n<p>To summarize, I think that GitHub Copilot is a bad idea as designed. It\nrepresents a flagrant disregard of FOSS licensing in of itself, and it enables\nsimilar disregard — deliberate or otherwise — among its users. I\nhope they will heed my suggestions, and I hope that my words to the free\nsoftware community offer some concrete ways to move forward with this problem.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Shout-out to Mozilla Common Voice, one of the few exceptions to this rule,\nwhich is an excellent project that has produced a high-quality, freely\navailable dataset of voice samples, and used it to develop free models and\nsoftware for text-to-speech and speech recognition. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fnref:1\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>Typically exploitative labor from low-development countries which the tech\nindustry often pretends isn&rsquo;t a hair&rsquo;s breadth away from slavery. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://drewdevault.com/blog/index.xml#fnref:2\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>"

We want some VLANs.  So let&#8217;s rewrite some things, and eliminate two of the switches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, let&#8217;s talk about the physical setup we had before.  Before, each of the different switches were connected to &#8220;raw&#8221; ports connecting to existing VLANs on my network:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>HEX: VAN9.  This is an existing client network in my homelab.  You plug something in here, it gets a 10.9.1.0/24 address, and instantly has Internet access. This is what the &#8220;WAN&#8221; port of VyOS connects to.</li><li>HAP: VLAN41.  This was a new VLAN I created to connect between eth1 on VyOS and the &#8220;enduser1&#8221; VM.</li><li>HEX LITE: VLAN42. Similarly, a new VLAN I created to connect between eth2 on VyOS and the &#8220;enduser2&#8221; VM.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Physically, this is how the new setup will look:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1234\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0494-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\" /><figcaption>getting cleaner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In most networking circles, a &#8220;trunk&#8221; just means a port carrying multiple VLANs.  Since we removed two switches, the remaining switch, the HEX, will need to have its uplink port changed into a trunk:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Remove HAP and HEX LITE switches</li><li>On the HEX, change the port that was previously connected to a raw VLAN9 port on my existing network to a trunk.</li><li>Plug eth1 from VyOS into port 4 on HEX, change the VLAN of that port to 41</li><li>Plug eth2 from VyOS into port 3 on HEX, change the VLAN of the port to 42</li><li>Change the VLAN on port 5 on the HEX to 9.  This will change the PVID, or the raw VLAN that&#8217;s use when whatever is plugged in on the other end isn&#8217;t speaking VLANs.</li><li>Due to the prior step, the nothing on VyOS will change</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The characteristics of our trunk ports will be simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>VLAN1 == PVID/untagged.  This is the VLAN traffic will land on if the traffic has no VLAN tags</li><li>VLAN9 == Tagged. </li><li>VLAN41 == Tagged</li><li>VLAN42 == Tagged</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the important changes on the remaining switch below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Add an Switched Virtual Interface or SVI.  This is saying &#8220;Give this switch an interface on this VLAN&#8221;.  This is important because VLAN9 is no longer the default &#8220;untagged&#8221; for the uplink port (ether1)</li><li>Change the PVIDs/default VLANs of the appropriate ports on the bridge.  We are doing this to make the VyOS-3040 think nothing has changed in our physical setup.</li><li>Handle VLAN filtering.  This is going to control what VLANs are allowed on these ports. This is how you create a trunk port in Mikrotik <ol><li><code>ether1</code> is the Trunk to the rest of the network.  It is untagged on VLAN1 (which is a throwaway VLAN for security).  It is tagged on the other two VLANs we are using, 41 and 42.</li><li><code>bridgeLocal</code> is Mikrotik itself. It is untagged on VLAN1 for similar reasons as above.  It it tagged on VLAN9 as this is what allows our newly created <code>VLAN9_SVI</code> so we can create a management address for it.</li><li><code>ether3/4/5</code> are all untagged on the VLANs that match the PVIDs.</li></ol></li><li>Finally, we tell the Mikrotik to pull its address via DHCP on the newly created <code>VLAN9_SVI</code></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># jun/29/2021 10:27:41 by RouterOS 6.48.3\n# software id = IMPN-EEMU\n#\n# model = RB750Gr3\n\n/interface bridge\nadd admin-mac=B8:69:F4:AB:2E:7A auto-mac=no comment=defconf name=bridgeLocal vlan-filtering=yes\n<strong>/interface vlan\nadd interface=bridgeLocal name=VLAN9_SVI vlan-id=9</strong>\n/interface bridge port\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal comment=defconf interface=ether1\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal comment=defconf interface=ether2\n<strong>add bridge=bridgeLocal comment=defconf interface=ether3 pvid=42\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal comment=defconf interface=ether4 pvid=41\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal comment=defconf interface=ether5 pvid=9</strong>\n/interface bridge vlan\n<strong>add bridge=bridgeLocal untagged=bridgeLocal,ether1 vlan-ids=1</strong>\n<strong>add bridge=bridgeLocal tagged=bridgeLocal,ether1 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=9\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal tagged=ether1 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=41\nadd bridge=bridgeLocal tagged=ether1 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=42</strong>\n/ip dhcp-client\n<strong>add comment=defconf disabled=no interface=VLAN9_SVI</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, everything just works as before.

This does not use SSH, but rather interacts directly with the VM over a virtual serial link using <code>qemu-guest-agent</code>, with commands executed as <code>root</code> inside the guest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dynamic inventory has a couple of requirements. It does not (yet) support SELinux in enforcing mode inside the guest; it requires the <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> service to be running inside the guest; the host must be able to query <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> successfully; and <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> needs to support the following capabilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>guest-exec</li><li>guest-file-close</li><li>guest-file-open</li><li>guest-file-read</li><li>guest-file-write</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of distros will blacklist these in the guest&#8217;s qemu guest agent configuration, so this might need to be removed and the service restarted. In CentOS, this is configured with the <code>BLACKLIST_RPC</code> option in the <code>/etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga</code> file, so you would need to modify that and restart the <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Install the collection</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, we first need to install the collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>Create an inventory file</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, to use it as a dynamic inventory and talk to a working <code>libvirtd</code>, we need to create an inventory file which provides the connection details for our hypervisor. In this example, we&#8217;re creating a file called <code>kvm.yml</code> which provides the <code>uri</code> to talk to the local daemon supervising QEMU domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" lang=\"yaml\">---\nplugin: community.libvirt.libvirt\nuri: 'qemu:///system'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have our inventory file, we can test it!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible-inventory --inventory kvm.yml --list</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-6748\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>This should return JSON formatted data, which looks like this on a hypervisor with no guests.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-json\" lang=\"json\">{\n    \"_meta\": {\n        \"hostvars\": {}\n    },\n    \"all\": {\n        \"children\": [\n            \"ungrouped\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h5>Inventory with a remote host</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The cool thing is that it supports standard URI connection strings, so we can also talk to remote libvirt hosts over SSH with an inventory like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" lang=\"yaml\">---\nplugin: community.libvirt.libvirt\nuri: 'qemu+ssh://user@server/system'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>Spin up VMs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>OK! Spin up some test virtual machines and try listing the inventory again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need a hand creating some VMs, then we can do it with my <a href=\"https://github.com/csmart/virt-infra-ansible\">Ansible virtual infrastructure playbook</a>, which pulls in <a href=\"https://github.com/csmart/ansible-role-virt-infra\">my role</a> and includes a sample inventory. Running this will also automatically install and start everything on <code>localhost</code> that we need for <code>libvirtd</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">git clone --recursive https://github.com/csmart/virt-infra-ansible.git\ncd virt-infra-ansible</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s grab the CentOS Stream 8 images and put them in place so that we can spin up the VMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">curl -O https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8-stream/x86_64/images/CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-8-20210603.0.x86_64.qcow2\nsudo mkdir -p /var/lib/libvirt/images\nsudo mv -iv CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-8-20210603.0.x86_64.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s create some extra args so that the Ansible role can put SELinux into permissive mode and configure <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> capabilities for us automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">cat &gt; /tmp/ansible-extra-args.json &lt;&lt; \\EOF\n{\n  \"virt_infra_disk_cmd\": [\n    \"sed -i s/^BLACKLIST_RPC=/\\\\#BLACKLIST_RPC=/ /etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga\",\n    \"sed -i s/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/ /etc/selinux/config\"\n  ]\n}\nEOF</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OK! Now we can spin up two VMs, <code>simple-centos-8-1</code> and <code>example-centos-8</code> from the included sample inventory and test if we can see them using the dynamic inventory.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">./run.sh --limit kvmhost,simple-centos-8-1,example-centos-8 --extra-vars \"@/tmp/ansible-extra-args.json\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This should successfully spin up those two machines, which we can remove cleanly in a later step. If you need to SSH into them for some reason, they should be configured with a local account that matches Linux username, with a password of <code>password</code> and be accessible with any of the SSH keys from your home directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ssh example-centos-8 uptime</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>Test the dynamic inventory</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s try the dynamic inventory again and see if we can find those new VMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible-inventory --inventory kvm.yml --list</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This time the returned JSON includes the VMs. Note that groups are automatically created for each host.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-json\" lang=\"json\">{\n    \"1c85f707-70bd-4449-9e74-0364329b2cae\": {\n        \"hosts\": [\n            \"simple-centos-8-1\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"73d59360-33f9-44e6-8c71-0ac2f6530c43\": {\n        \"hosts\": [\n            \"example-centos-8\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"_meta\": {\n        \"hostvars\": {\n            \"example-centos-8\": {\n                \"ansible_connection\": \"community.libvirt.libvirt_qemu\",\n                \"ansible_libvirt_uri\": \"qemu:///system\"\n            },\n            \"simple-centos-8-1\": {\n                \"ansible_connection\": \"community.libvirt.libvirt_qemu\",\n                \"ansible_libvirt_uri\": \"qemu:///system\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"all\": {\n        \"children\": [\n            \"1c85f707-70bd-4449-9e74-0364329b2cae\",\n            \"73d59360-33f9-44e6-8c71-0ac2f6530c43\",\n            \"ungrouped\"\n        ]\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>Test guest agent</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We can use the <code>virsh</code> command line tool to test that the host is able to communicate with the guest agent running in the VM, and that it supports the capabilities that we need. Let&#8217;s do that now, against one of the example VMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">sudo virsh qemu-agent-command example-centos-8 '{\"execute\":\"guest-info\"}' --pretty</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, this needs to work and secondly, it should return a list of supported commands where you can ensure the required capabilities are enabled and working.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Use the dynamic inventory with Ansible</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have a working inventory and have confirmed the guest agent connection is working, we can use Ansible to dynamically generate an inventory and connect to the guests. Again, this doesn&#8217;t use SSH, but rather the <code>gemu-guest-agent</code> interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s test this using the standard Ansible <code>ping</code> module.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible --inventory kvm.yml all -m ping</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We should see a successful response!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"\">simple-centos-8-1 | SUCCESS =&gt; {\n    \"ansible_facts\": {\n        \"discovered_interpreter_python\": \"/usr/libexec/platform-python\"\n    },\n    \"changed\": false,\n    \"ping\": \"pong\"\n}\nexample-centos-8 | SUCCESS =&gt; {\n    \"ansible_facts\": {\n        \"discovered_interpreter_python\": \"/usr/libexec/platform-python\"\n    },\n    \"changed\": false,\n    \"ping\": \"pong\"\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course we can run real playbooks. Here&#8217;s an example playbook called <code>site.yml</code> to install critical packages <img alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" lang=\"yaml\">---\n- hosts: all\n  tasks:\n    - name: Install packages\n      package:\n        name:\n          - git\n          - rsync\n          - tmux\n          - vim\n        state: present\n      become: true\n      register: result_package_install\n      retries: 10\n      delay: 5\n      until: result_package_install is succeeded</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s run it!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible-playbook --inventory kvm.yml site.yml</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And we should see that it happily executes the playbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"\">PLAY [all] ******************************************************************************************\n\nTASK [Gathering Facts] ******************************************************************************\nok: [simple-centos-8-1]\nok: [example-centos-8]\n\nTASK [Install packages] *****************************************************************************\nchanged: [example-centos-8]\nchanged: [simple-centos-8-1]\n\nPLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************\nexample-centos-8     : ok=2  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0    skipped=0  rescued=0  ignored=0   \nsimple-centos-8-1    : ok=2  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0    skipped=0  rescued=0  ignored=0   </code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h5>Limiting the hosts with dynamic inventory</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a working dynamic inventory, you can use the standard Ansible <code>limit</code> option to restrict machines for your playbooks. This way you can have the flexibility of the dynamic inventory, but restrict which guests you execute Ansible against.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">ansible-playbook --inventory kvm.yml --limit example-centos-8 site.yml</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>Remove test VMs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we can cleanly remove those test VMs using the same Ansible code, by setting their state to <code>undefined</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code class=\"language-bash line-numbers\" lang=\"bash\">./run.sh --limit kvmhost,simple-centos-8-1,example-centos-8 -e virt_infra_state=undefined</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And there you have it. Using the dynamic inventory with the libvirt plugin can be quite handy.</p>"

In fact very little of my infrastructure was managed by Terraform. Recently though, I decided to start moving most external services to it. In keeping with my theme of trying to automate my infrastructure and avoid manual changes, it made sense to finally start using Terraform for my personal usage of external services.</p>\n<p>Ansible and Salt still control what runs on my machines (including VPSs/instances on cloud providers), but managing external services makes a lot of sense with Terraform. While Ansible and Salt are good at making changes, they don&rsquo;t manage &ldquo;desired state&rdquo; very well, in the sense that Ansible can create a VPS on Hetzner, but it does not know that one may already exist.</p>\n<p>With Terraform, it knows what resources it manages (using State management), and whether they should already exist or not. Terraform may still be incorrect as to the state of a resource, but usually only if the resource changed since the last time Terraform ran. Something like Ansible will just try to make the same changes it did last time, which could lead to duplicate resources, or the Playbook failing because it can&rsquo;t create a resource (because it already exists and can&rsquo;t be created again).</p>\n<p>The following covers what I use: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloudflare for external DNS\n<ul>\n<li>This includes externally accessibly domains</li>\n<li>It also includes &ldquo;internal&rdquo; domains I use that I want valid Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificates for</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Digital Ocean and Hetzner for VPSs\n<ul>\n<li>My blog and other external services (RSS, Read-It-Later, Black Box Exporter for monitoring) are hosted on these</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Platform and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for the always-free virtual machines</li>\n<li>Lab/Proxmox for testing technologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For most of these, the steps are the same, with some minor differences in variable/secrets for each provider). In some cases, extra steps are required. I&rsquo;ll first show the most basic pipeline (the one used for Cloudflare DNS) and then show some of the extra steps in others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"full-drone-pipeline---cloudflare\">Full Drone Pipeline -

This uses the same Slack notification steps, the same kind of triggers/conditionals for running steps, and runs as a single Docker-based pipeline (rather than the multiple pipelines required for <a href=\"https://yetiops.net/posts/home-infra-overhaul-part6-drone-salt/#full-drone-pipeline\">Salt</a>).</p>\n<p>The bulk of the Terraform-specific steps in the pipelines use the <a href=\"https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/terraform\">Terraform Drone plugin</a>. It is possible to use the official Hashicorp Terraform Docker image, but the Drone plugin is a little more convenient.

A volume is a shared directory/path that can be made available to other steps within a pipeline.</p>\n<p>For Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, the GPG key is required to authenticate against the API, whereas the SSH keys (specifically the public key) are used in the <code>cloud-init</code>/user data to bootstrap the instances.

In this case it make files available between steps, allowing authentication to certain providers.</p>\n<p>The same step is used in my Lab Terraform when creating Proxmox virtual machines. This is because <a href=\"https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">cloud-init</a> in Proxmox requires adding files directly to the Proxmox host&rsquo;s file system (rather than being stored in an API). In my case, I use SSH/SCP within Terraform to transfer the files to the Proxmox host(s), using the Drone SSH keys for authentication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remote-state-backend-with-consul\">Remote State Backend with Consul</h2>\n<p>While not specific to Drone, using some form of Remote State Backend within Terraform allows the following: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A central place to source state between Drone jobs and local Terraform testing</li>\n<li>Using Remote State as a data source in Terraform code</li>\n<li>State Locking - avoids multiple jobs/people applying changes at the same time (and potentially breaking each others changes)\n<ul>\n<li>Not all backends support this, and some require a separate backend for locking (e.g. AWS S3 for state storage, and DynamoDB for state locking)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Most importantly, it means Drone does not need to write to a <code>terraform.tfstate</code> file in the repository and push it back to the repository after changes are made</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last point is especially pertinent, as without this the following steps would be required: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a cache/state volume in the pipeline</li>\n<li>Make the Terraform Drone plugin place state files in the volume</li>\n<li>Run a step after each Terraform Apply stage to add, commit and push changes back to the code repository\n<ul>\n<li>This also means giving Drone access to push (and not just pull/clone rights) access to the repository</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, using a Remote State Backend means none of these extra steps are required. Many different options for Backends are available (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etcd, Postgres), but I chose Consul as I already run Consul for <a href=\"https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-node_exporter/\">Prometheus Service Discovery</a>.</p>\n<p>Setting up this backend looks like the below: -</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-hcl\"><span style=\"color: #66d9ef;\">terraform</span> {\n  <span style=\"color: #66d9ef;\">backend</span> <span style=\"color: #e6db74;\">\"consul\"</span> {\n    address <span style=\"color: #f92672;\">=</span> <span style=\"color: #e6db74;\">\"consul.noisepalace.co.uk\"</span>\n    scheme  <span style=\"color: #f92672;\">=</span> <span style=\"color: #e6db74;\">\"https\"</span>\n    path    <span style=\"color: #f92672;\">=</span> <span style=\"color: #e6db74;\">\"terraform/oraclecloud/oci\"</span>\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>The path structure is arbitrary. I decided to use a <code>$APPLICATION/$PROVIDER/$PURPOSE</code> structure, but you could name each one after characters in Star Wars or Transformers if you wished! This stores state in the Consul KV store, as shown below: -</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Drone Terraform Consul KV store\" src=\"https://yetiops.net/img/homeinfra/drone-terraform-consul.png\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"demonstration\">Demonstration</h2>\n<p>The below video is a demonstration of making a change to the Terraform repository and committing it. In this step I am going to create a DNS record in Cloudflare: -</p>\n\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  \n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>In this, we have seen how to can make use of Drone to apply Terraform configuration.</p>\n<p>This has also shown how we can make use of Consul to provide a consistent Backend for Terraform, reducing the need for additional steps to manage Terraform state files with Drone.</p>\n<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;m going to cover using Drone to build Go releases.</p>"

      "summary": "<pre># Introduction\n\nLet's have fun today. I always wondered how I would sell OpenBSD licences to customers if I was a salesperson.\n\nThis text is pure fiction and fun.  The OpenBSD project is free of charge and under a libre software licence.\n\n=> https://www.openbsd.org/ Website of The OpenBSD Project\n\n# Killer features\n\nWhen selling a product, it's always important to talk about the killer features, what makes a product a good one and why it would solve the customer problems.\n\n## Learn once\n\nIf you were to use OpenBSD, you certainly would have a slight learning curve, but then the system is so stable over time that the acquired knowledge would be reused from release to release.  Most base tools in OpenBSD are evolving while keeping compatibility with regard to how you administrate them.\n\nCan we say so for the Linux ecosystem which changes its sound and init system every 5 years?  Can we say so for Windows which revisites most of its interface at every new release?\n\nLearning OpenBSD is a good investment that will save you time later, so you can use your computer without frustration.\n\n# Secure by default\n\nOpenBSD comes with strong security defaults, you don't have to tweak anything, the development did it for you!  You can confidently use your OpenBSD computer, and you will be safe from all the bad actors targetting mainstream systems.\n\nEven more, OpenBSD takes care of your privacy and doesn't run any telemetry, doesn't record what you type, doesn't upload any data.  The team took care of disabling microphone and webcam by faking their input stream with empty data until you explicitely allow one or the other to record audio/video.\n\n## Community driven\n\nBecause you certainly don't want to suffer from big IT actors decisions affecting your favorite OS, OpenBSD is community driven and take care of not being infecting by big tech agendas.  The system is made for the developers, by the developers, and you can use it as a customer!  Doesn't this feel great to know the authors use their own software?\n\n## No obsolescence / eco-friendly\n\nRest assured that your brand-new computer will still be able to run OpenBSD in 20 years.  The team is taking a special care of keeping compatibility for older hardware until it's too hard to find spare components.  It's almost a lifetime of system upgrades for your hardware!  Are the competitors still supporting Sparc64 and 32-bit PowerPC for a modern computer experience? I don't think so!  The installer is still available for floppy disk, I think this says it all!\n\n## Very low maintenance\n\nAs OpenBSD is designed to be highly resilient and so simple that it can't break, be sure you won't waste time fixing problems on your system.  With a FREE major update every six months and regular security updates, your system keeps being bulletproof with no more maintenance from you than running the update; more experienced users can even automate this using the built-in and free of charge task scheduler.\n\n## Licencing\n\nOpenBSD is perfect for people who want to become rich!  Think about this, you love your OpenBSD system, and you want to make a product out of it? Perfect!  The licencing allows you to make changes to OpenBSD, redistribute it, charge people for it, and you don't even have to show a single line of your product source code to your customers.  This is a perfect licencing for people who would like to build proprietary devices based on OpenBSD, a rock solid system.\n\nAgainst all industry standards, in case you would improve your OpenBSD, you are allowed to make changes to it without losing the warrantly coming with the licensing.\n\n## Technical support\n\nIf you ever need help, you will have direct access for free to the mailing lists of the project, allowing you to exchange directly with the people developping OpenBSD.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDon't be afraid to jump into OpenBSD from another operating system, we took care of documenting everything you will need.  We are very proud of our documentation, and you can even use your OpenBSD system without Internet connectivity and still being able to read the top-notch documentation to configure your system to your needs.  No more need to use a search engine to find old blog posts with outdated and inaccurate advice.\n\n## Fast to install\n\nYou can install OpenBSD very fast by just answering to a few questions about the setup.  However, you should never need to install OpenBSD more than once so most people will never notice about it.  Experimented users can even automate installation to spread OpenBSD to their family without effort.\n\n# Behind the scenes\n\nOf course, as a good salesperson, I would have to avoid some topics because this would make the customer lose interest into OpenBSD.  However, they could be turned as a positive fact:\n\n* OpenBSD doesn't support Bluetooth, but you can see this as a security feature.  The code was entirely removed from the kernel because Bluetooth is full of traps and could easily leak data over the air.  You certainly don't want that?\n* You may think OpenBSD slow performance could hit your productivity, but on the contrary it's a feature that will prevent you from losing focus on what you are currently working on.  Think about the Tortoise and the Hare!\n* Maybe your favorite software is proprietary and will not be provided for OpenBSD, then your provider is entirely at fault because they don't want to make their software compliant with OpenBSD strong quality requirements to provide a working binary\n* You may have heard some hardware won't run on OpenBSD, this can happen for very niche hardware.  The OpenBSD team is working hard to give you the best experience on a selection of affordable hardware with premium support.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI hope you understood this was a fiction; OpenBSD is free and anyone can use it.  It has strength and weaknesses, as always it's important to use the right tool for the right job.  The team would be happy to receive contributions from you if you want to improve OpenBSD, by doing so you could help me improve my speech as a saleperson.\n\n=> static/take-my-money.png \"Take my money\" meme\n</pre>",

What somewhat sparked these thoughts is\nresearch i did in the past years, but also very much <a href=\"https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-10-21-huge-disaster-recovery-plan.html\">this blog article</a>\nwhich very much deals with the question of how we <em>could</em> rebuild the Internet\nonce our world has finished properly burning down.</p>\n\n<p>However, up until then, we live in a <em>burning world</em>, i.e., one evaporating\nunder the human-made climate emergency and countless other shifts we find\nourselves in at the moment. The Internet of today will certainly neither be\nsustainable nor resilient in the future we are heading towards.</p>\n\n<p>Together with my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aschenbrennerin\">Doris Aschenbrenner</a> i wrote down these\nthoughts in a <a href=\"https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3390006_1/component/file_3390007/content\">paper</a> in the form of “13 propositions”, which will\nappear in the proceedings of the joint workshops on <a href=\"https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2022/workshop-taurin-bgi.html\">“Technologies,\nApplications, and Uses of a Responsible Internet” and “Building Greener\nInternet”</a>, colocated with <a href=\"https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2022/\">ACM SIGCOMM</a> later this year.\n(Feel free to click through the paper already and get some spoilers… or \nwait for a new article every day… the choice is yours. :-) )</p>\n\n<p>So, given the silence in my blog (to end soon; i was a bit busy with overdoing\nthis selfhosting stuff a … bit more), i figured it might be a nice way to\nget some content up here again; So, for the next 13 days i will go over one of \nthese propositions every day, and talk a bit more about the context of them.</p>\n\n<p>Note, that our propositions are based on our own research contributions\npublished in the past, public discourse, and are most certainly rooted in\nsystem administration lore and our own experience as system administrators.\nThey are intentionally bold, and we make no personal claim to originality and\ncompleteness.</p>\n\n<p>So, here we go with the first one:</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"proposition-1\">Proposition 1</h1>\n<p><em>“Operating systems requires operators to execute care, towards their system, their users, and the infrastructure as a whole.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Note, that this one is very much not about <a href=\"https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf\"><em>Operating Systems</em></a>, but\ninstead more about the process of running and maintaining a system.</p>\n\n<p>In the first line, this statement draws on work by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MannnatKaur\">Mannat Kaur</a>, a PhD\ncandidate i have the privilege of working with, who takes a unique\nsafety-science and feminism informed perspective on human factors and system\nadministration.</p>\n\n<p>In her <a href=\"https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3384326_3/component/file_3384541/content\">recent paper (pre-print)</a>, she took a look at how sysadmins\ncoordinated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic hitting. The rather striking\nobservation made by her is that system administration has a major component of\ncare work and emotional labor.  This may be self-evident to any system\nadministrator who ever had a user ask them if they happened to have <em>‘a\nbackup’</em> of something important said user lost.  Maintaining the user’s\nemotions, fear, and anxiety, regardless of whether a backup is present, is the\nmajor part of the task.</p>\n\n<p>However, we also claim that the necessity to care for users extends beyond this\nexample.  To operate systems means <em>caring</em> to create those backups in the\nfirst place.  System administrators need to plan in advance, anticipating\nneeds, and provide solutions for problems before they materialize and are\nrealized by users.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, system administration means caring for systems in their whole life\ncycle.  While building a system is fun, ensuring that it keeps running is a\ndifferent and more complex task—especially under the security and privacy\nguarantees users expect.  Following, e.g., the gist of Limoncelli et al.’s\n<a href=\"https://everythingsysadmin.com/books.html\">book on system administration</a>, providing a service is a\nresponsibility that has to be fulfilled, and the <em>hard</em> part is <em>continuing</em> to\nfulfill it.</p>\n\n<p>So, if we want the Internet to sustain in our burning future, we have to reorient\nourselves to <em>actually caring</em> for infrastructure and its users. If we do that,\ndigital infrastructure might give us an edge in surviving the future to come.\nIf we don’t start caring soon, it may very well become a liability (if it is\nnot so already) further dragging us down.</p>"

          "value": "<p>When non-lawyer folks ask me about reading some law for themselves, four sources come up again and again:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"supreme-court-syllabi\">Supreme Court Syllabi</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://supremecourt.gov\">US Supreme Court</a> has an in-house publishing department called the “Reporter of Decisions” that adds outline summaries, or “syllabi”, to the fronts of all major published court decisions.  For example, the first eight pages of the recent <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">abortion decision in the <em>Dobbs</em> case</a> are all syllabus.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t get turned off by the cryptic, sentence-like runs of italicized names, abbreviations, and numbers.  These are legal “citations” that reference texts like other court decisions, statutes, regulations, scholarly articles, and so on.  It’s perfectly fine to skim the citations when reading for a general sense of what was decided and how it was justified.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Reporter usually summarizes only the “opinion of the court”—the written decision that a majority of justices signed onto.  There may also be “concurring” and “dissenting” opinions in the PDF, agreeing or disagreeing with the opinion of the court.  For example, the dissenting opinion of Justice Breyer in <em>Dobbs</em> begins on PDF page 148.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t be afraid of the large PDF page counts.  Some opinions run long.  But the Reporter uses generous margins and type, designed for <a href=\"https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/06/Printing-Booklets\">printing booklets</a> or marking up.  The justices also have a habit of heaping on supporting material at the ends of some opinions, like the appendices at the ends of <em>both</em> majority and dissent in <em>Dobbs</em>.  They take a lot of pages.  They’re rarely worth more than a quick skim.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"model-jury-instructions\">Model Jury Instructions</h2>\n\n<p>When lawsuits go to trial before a jury, the judge ends up giving the jury a big packet of instructions for how to decide each legal claim in the case.  Because these instructions get used so much, and because screwing them up can require a trial do-over, appeals courts often publish big books of model jury instructions.  In other words, the appeals courts themselves publish summaries of legal rules specifically for non-lawyers to read, understand, and apply.</p>\n\n<p>Do not get too excited.  I wish I could say they went as far as using actual English.  But at least if it’s still legalese, it comes in smaller bites.</p>\n\n<p>Here in California, both the federal <a href=\"https://www.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/105\">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/juryinstructions.htm\">California state courts</a> publish model jury instructions online.  They’re organized into criminal-law and civil-law sets, then broken down by subject.  The instructions themselves come with comments that cite important cases and statutes.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/sites/default/files/WPD/Civil_Instructions_2022_3_0.pdf\">Ninth Circuit civil instructions</a> have a whole section on copyright, starting on PDF page 392. The <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/Judicial_Council_of_California_Civil_Jury_Instructions.pdf\">2022 California civil instructions</a> have a whole series on contracts, starting on PDF page 153.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples--explanations\">Examples &amp; Explanations</h2>\n\n<p>Most textbooks that law students have to buy are big, expensive, poorly edited faculty bodge-jobs that nobody would pay for otherwise.  $150 tomes in fancy binding, often full of typos and formatting errors.  It’s a racket.  Most legal study guides are also pretty terrible and expensive.  The <a href=\"https://www.aspenpublishing.com/study-aids/examples-explanations\">Examples &amp; Explanations</a> series is the exception.  As a rule, they’re affordable, thoughtfully written, and carefully edited.  How this is possible, I know not still.</p>\n\n<p>E&amp;Es are available for all the mandatory first-year-of-law-school courses, plus most of the common electives at second- and third-year level.  If you want an overview of a general area of law, like contracts, intellectual property, or personal tax, this should be your first bet.  And you can probably get by with a used copy of an old edition in most fields, especially the first-year subjects.</p>\n\n<p>I personally try to read or review an E&amp;E each year.  I’m not embarrassed to admit this, or to shelve the books in my office.  I’m embarrassed fundamental review isn’t the norm in my profession.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"legislative-research-services\">Legislative Research Services</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to proposed legislation, state and federal, it’s often way easier to read a summary or impact analysis than the text of the project itself, especially when amendments are still flying.  Fortunately, many legislatures fund independent, non-partisan research services in-house, whose job it is to analyze bills.  These days, the analyses go up online.</p>\n\n<p>At the federal level, that’s the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/\">Congressional Research Service</a>.  For California, it’s the <a href=\"https://sfa.senate.ca.gov/whatisthesenateofficeofflooranalysis\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/assembly-floor-analysis\">Assembly</a> “floor analysis” groups, plus the <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/\">Legislative Analyst’s Office</a>, that last especially for the budget.</p>\n\n<p>The Congressional Research Service in particular is a really underappreciated resource.  They more or less function as a federal public think tank.  In addition to guides on specific legislative projects, they often publish background pieces summarizing existing legislation under debate or giving broader context on a whole area of policy.  For example, <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46751\">here’s a report on Section 230</a> from last year.  And <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45008\">here’s one from December on the US, Ukraine, and Russia</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It’s your law, people.  Don’t let lawyers scare you off of reading it!</p>"

An\nunfortunate truth that's gotten me past that is realizing my parents most\nlikely do not remember how their actions and/or words affected me. While I'm\nsimmering over events that transpired a decade or more prior, they're living\ntheir lives — watching TV, doing laundry, figuring out what to eat, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>I know now I was willingly engaging in mental self-harm.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I had a bit of back-and-forth with my father about COVID-19 in the\nfamily group chat. Mask mandates, vaccine effectiveness, &quot;narratives,&quot; &quot;COVID\nfear messaging and marketing,&quot; the works. Needless to say, the conversation\ndevolved into petty remarks so I stopped responding (ironically, my father\nstated he wanted respect for his views while gaslighting me for mine, but\nI digress).</p>\n<p>I won't lie, the conversation bothered me. It feels like I lost my father to\nFox News and conspiracy websites with dubious sources, one of which he\npresented as wholly factual and apparent proof of my idiocy.</p>\n<p>My relationship with my parents have not been the best but in recent years I've\nbeen trying to work through my issues with being close to them for the reasons\nmentioned at the top of this post. But uh, wow…it was relatively easy to slide\nback into those negative thoughts I used to have. Too easy.</p>\n<p>I awoke today, refreshed and, thinking about how I used to see my parents when\nI was a young kid. After all, I <strong>am</strong> a product of their teachings,\nintentional and otherwise.</p>\n<p>What I learned from my father:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It takes two people to argue (the irony is not lost on me).</li>\n<li>Ensure doors and windows are closed and locked before heading to bed.</li>\n<li>There are no new problems in the world. If you have a problem, someone's\nwritten a book about it.</li>\n<li>Look someone in the eye when shaking their hand.</li>\n<li>If you have something to say, be clear. Say it with your chest.</li>\n<li>Hard work and dedication is how you get things done.</li>\n<li>Being responsible is the single best trait you can have.</li>\n<li>Games are good.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I learned from my mother:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't ever let someone tell you you can't do something.</li>\n<li>To say &quot;I'm sorry&quot; is to say, &quot;I'm a sorry person.&quot; &quot;I apologize,&quot; is better.</li>\n<li>Art is good.</li>\n<li>Techno is good.</li>\n<li>Be yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I learned from both my parents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parenting doesn't end just because a marriage does.</li>\n<li>No one escapes consequences.</li>\n<li>Every person in the world is trying their best with the cards they're dealt.</li>\n<li>Racism sucks, is stupid, and definitely doesn't make sense. Especially since\nBlack people built this country (America).</li>\n<li>I can do anything I put my mind to.</li>\n<li>The truth shall set you free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are all shaped by the experiences life either politely sends or violently\nthrows our way. Much of the sadness we feel when thinking of the past is the\nfact that the people we miss from back then are not the same people we know\nnow. Sure, they may respond to the same name, and may even have the same phone\nnumber, but we are all changing, all the time.</p>\n<p>For better or worse. 🕸</p>"

I have fond memories of falling asleep to the likes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Williams_(talk_radio_host)\">Bruce Williams</a> who just gave damned good, level-headed advice.  It was, at essence, both optimistic and temperate:  a cool head to help people work through a tough spot.</p>\n<p>Nothing really replaced the call-in show:  talk radio devolved into poisonous echo chambers, while social networking gave people other outlets (too many!) to have conversations.  But these online conversations &#8212; the written word &#8212; lack something: Twitter&#8217;s tight form gives us the hot take, blogs (ahem!) give us the longer form, but it both cases, the conversations that result seem to either lose their sizzle or go thermonuclear.  Video is really great for some stuff (I have spoken about the rise of video and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PaWFYm0kEw\">preservation of oral tradition in software engineering</a>) &#8212; but the discussion quality there is even worse.  (When did YouTube comments become such a hellhole?!) And of course, TikTok has given us social, short-form video, which can be very entertaining, but isn&#8217;t really designed to induce any meaningful discussion.</p>\n<p>And of course, I love podcasts, and one of the reasons I was excited to <a href=\"http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2019/12/02/the-soul-of-a-new-computer-company/\">start a company</a> was to get an excuse to make <a href=\"https://oxide.computer/podcast/\">the podcast that we ourselves always wanted</a>.  Podcasts are particularly great because you can <strong>do something else</strong> while listening to them:  they fill in that time when you&#8217;re doing the dishes or picking up the kids or whatever.  But podcasts obviously miss the interactivity entirely.  (Or mostly: let us not so quickly forget <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1261207048340951041\">TWiV reading my letter on-air</a>!)</p>\n<p>Into all of this, enter Clubhouse and the rise of social audio.  I had immediate Bruce Williams flashbacks, and was excited to participate.  But my choice of device makes me unwelcome in Clubhouse&#8217;s eyes:  their lack of an Android app is clearly not a mere temporary gap, but rather a deliberate deprioritization.  (I certainly honor a young company&#8217;s need to focus, but how else can one describe an exceedingly well-capitalized company adding in-app payments before addressing 75% of the market?!)  To me, the deprioritization of Android reflects Clubhouse&#8217;s deeper problem:  it is fundamentally elitist and exclusionary.  Avid Clubhouse users may claim that this was not always so, but <strong>it says it right there on the tin</strong>:  it is, at the end of the day, a <em>clubhouse</em> &#8212; not a cafe or a town square.  I personally have no interest in participating in venues that deliberately limit the participants:  I want to engage with the broadest possible cross-section, not some subset that has been manicured by circumstance or technology choice.  (For this same reason, I do not give talks unless the talk will be recorded and made freely available.)</p>\n<p>Given all of this, you can imagine my enthusiasm for Twitter Spaces: it captures the promise that I see in the medium &#8212; but addresses many of the problems with Clubhouse&#8217;s implementation.  I have been participating in them for the past few weeks and (excitingly!) found last week that I have the ability to create Spaces.  Here are my takeaways so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>This is an even bigger deal than I thought it was.</strong>  All of the strengths that I perceived in the medium seem to be even stronger than I thought they would be, and in particular &#8212; as with podcasts &#8212; I can have a conversation while I do something else.  It is really nice to have social networking time after which one looks back at a clean kitchen or a prepared meal!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spaces have broadened the people I follow.</strong>  In every Space I have been in, I have come away following someone new.  I find one of the most interesting aspects of Twitter to be able to be a part of conversations and social circles that broaden our perspectives (socially, technically, or otherwise) &#8212; and Spaces takes this to a new level:  I find that I&#8217;m following people based on a comment that they make that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see in the din of my feed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spaces have felt very playful.</strong>  In so many ways, this reminds me of early social networking circa 2003 &#8212; or of first getting online a decade prior.  It just feels new, and fresh, and&#8230; fun!  For example, I was in one space where a security researcher that I revere was with their crew, all trying to find ways to hack the captioning.  (They made some interesting discoveries: because the captioning is done locally, they can actually reveal more about you than what you actually say!)  I was more or less laughing the whole time; it was delightful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The content is golden.</strong>  If I have one complaint about Spaces, it&#8217;s that they aren&#8217;t publicly recorded &#8212; because there&#8217;s some great content here!  I am hoping that this gets added over time (obviously, opt-in and clear to all participants!), because speaking personally, I want to go back and listen to an awesome Space that I might have missed &#8212; and I want others to be able to do the same with any Space that I host.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>People have been really nice!</strong>  Okay, this is a little one, but I think an essential one:  in every Space I&#8217;ve been in, the people have just been incredibly friendly and welcoming.  One of the challenges of the written word is that it&#8217;s too easy to be nasty:  our mirror neurons don&#8217;t fire when our damage is inflicted at a distance.  (Take it from the guy still trying to apologize for a Usenet comment from several decades ago!)  While it&#8217;s still obviously very early for Twitter Spaces, being in a spoken conversation makes us much more predisposed to empathy &#8212; and I&#8217;m optimistic that the medium will retain the decency that we have lost elsewhere, allowing us a venue to listen to and learn from other perspectives.   I also really like Twitter&#8217;s emphasis on safety &#8212; and I&#8217;m hopeful that the inevitable bad behavior that does crop up is taken care of pretty quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clubhouse is in trouble.</strong>  I have been in a couple of Spaces where Clubhouse comes up (indeed, one of the Spaces I was in was a security researcher reporting how poorly Clubhouse handled a pretty serious safety issue that she had found), and in all of those conversations, the tenor is more or less the same:  there was a brief moment last summer (especially, post George Floyd) when Clubhouse felt really important &#8212; profound, even &#8212; but their poor execution since has driven people away.  In this regard, my early social networking metaphor may be apt in more ways than one: Clubhouse feels like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster\">Friendster</a>.  And just as Friendster hit on something huge (social networking!) for the wrong reasons (the founder&#8217;s desire to find dates!), Clubhouse&#8217;s focus on listening to famous people feels misplaced.  (Speaking for myself, I am looking for conversations, not outtakes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Music\">Behind the Music</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hosting has been rewarding.</strong>  So far, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1386765936405872641\">I have hosted one Space</a>, convincing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ahl\">Adam</a> to join me so I wouldn&#8217;t die alone.  I think it&#8217;s fair to say that Adam was somewhat skeptical going in, but came out seeing promise in the medium.  For example, one participant was dialing in from central Asia (where it was 4a!), and we ended up in a discussion on how insulated kids can become from the underlying mechanics of how computers actually work.  He decribed that growing up needing to rely on second-hand computers was an essential part of his own technical education &#8212; that having less made him need to understand more.  It was a moment that had everyone reflecting, and I&#8217;m honestly not sure how else that little interaction would have happened.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all, very positive and promising!  Of course, there are still lots of things to stub your toe on; this is still new, after all, and lots of stuff doesn&#8217;t work quite right.  And there&#8217;s also a lot to be figured out by those of us who will use the medium (reminder: retweets were invented by users, not by Twitter!).  For my part from a hosting perspective, I am going to take some inspiration from talk radio and experiment with both regularity and time-bounds:  Adam and I are going to host a Space again tomorrow (Monday) at 5p Pacific, keeping it again to about an hour.  (We appear to be aided in our time bounds last week by a memory leak that caused my app to abort after about an hour!)  So if you&#8217;re interested, drop on by &#8212; we&#8217;d love to hear what you have to say, which indeed is very much the whole point!</p>"
