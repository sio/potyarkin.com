# Known bugs


# Improvements

- SSL with CloudFare / CloudFront
- Inline code blocks with `@media print` can look better
- Next/previous post links below the full post page
- Tag cloud in a separate page
- Generate sitemap.xml?


# Future post ideas
- Why software localization is a waste of time (generally)
    - Disclaimer: I am not a developer (IANAD~IANAL)
    - Localization = bad, internationalization = good
    - It's all abstractions anyway
    - Documentation localization = documentation translation = good
    - UI localization ~~ so-so
    - If customer is paying for localization - why not
    - Opensource contributors... Can't force people, but those skills can
      bring more benefit elsewhere (documentation, issue tracker: confirming
      bugs, "advertising")
