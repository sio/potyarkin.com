hidden costs of sustaining modern (open source) digital infrastructure. Here it

Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Nadia Eghbal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay was created with support from the Ford Foundation and is published on
their website under a Creative Commons license. Unfortunately, that website
denies access to users from certain countries (like Russia), so here is a
&lt;a href="https://potyarkin.com/posts/2018/roads-and-bridges-sustaining-modern-digital-infrastructure/roads-and-bridges.pdf"&gt;mirror of PDF version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author discusses important and often overlooked topics of why open source
software gets built and by whom, of who pays the costs of building and
maintaining that software and of how to ensure that the software we all rely
upon continues to be &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;. The essay poses more questions than it
answers, but I still consider it the best read on the topic of sustaining open
source development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case Nadia Eghbal was "preaching to the converted" so this post is me
trying to spread her word. Please read her essay and please do not take open
source software for granted. The costs of building it are just payed by others,
may be you can figure out how to help them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="bookmarks"></category><category term="opensource"></category></entry><entry><title>Portable development setup for Python on Windows</title><link href="https://potyarkin.com/posts/2017/portable-development-setup-for-python-on-windows/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-20T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2017-09-20T00:00:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Vitaly Potyarkin</name></author><id>tag:potyarkin.com,2017-09-20:/posts/2017/portable-development-setup-for-python-on-windows/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="winpython"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#winpython"&gt;WinPython&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pip works just fine, but installing packages that require C compiler is
always a pain on Windows. May be I should look into conda and see if it
offers a portable variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; there are unofficial binary wheels for most common Python packages
at &lt;a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/"&gt;http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/&lt;/a&gt; The site's hosting is a little
unreliable, so it might take a few trys to fetch a package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git for Windows is now recommended by official Git website, and there always
is a portable version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package provides not only Git but also bash and a basic MSYS environment
(coreutils, sed, grep, awk, etc) which make life on Windows &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; easier!
Also, it comes with VIM preinstalled, which is a damn good editor and is
preferred by many developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gnu-make"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#gnu-make"&gt;GNU Make&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=make"&gt;http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=make&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Git for Windows does not come with GNU make preinstalled, so
we have to download it manually. Great guys at Equation Solution are regularly
building standalone versions of GNU Make for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloaded file has to be placed somewhere in PATH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-with-ssh-keys"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#github-with-ssh-keys"&gt;GitHub with SSH keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/"&gt;https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it is even possible to setup HTTPS authentication without
installing GitHub Desktop, and SSH key authentication works with GitHub
same as everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep the keys on my laptop and the rest of the environment is on a thumb
drive. That way I can develop anywhere I want, Windows comes as a given (sadly),
and I don't have to worry about keys security, because they are not exposed
to random computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official documentation recommends using HTTPS just because it's easier for
newcomers (&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11041729"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11041729&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not require generating public/private keys and uploading the correct
  one to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS is allowed everywhere and SSH might be blocked by a firewall&lt;/li&gt;
