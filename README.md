# Rendered static website
This directory contains rendered contents for the website located at
<http://potyarkin.ml>

# Important!
Editing any file in this directory is futile, because all changes will be
overwritten upon next rendering.

# On misleading directory naming
The directory with rendered website is named `docs`, which is quite misleading.
This is unavoidable because GitHub Pages supports publishing either from the
root of the repository, or from `docs`. Having one misleading directory name
is better than having to maintain two separate repos for source files and for
publishing.
