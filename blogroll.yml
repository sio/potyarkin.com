    - title: Wandering Thoughts
      by: Chris Siebenmann at University of Toronto

        Fifteen years of almost daily articles on Unix/Linux and Python. Very
        interesting findings on Unix history from a person who had experienced
        most of it firsthand. Some less important news, scripts and
        philosophical musings on the role of software in our lives.

        The author hosts his blog at employer's hosting and domain name, so I
        wouldn't be surprised if the blog would go offline one day. Let's hope
        the Web Archive runs its spiders regularly.

        tricky problems he uses Unix and Python knowledge to solve.

        Sometimes, it is fun to do stupid things. This blog documents things done on
        AS59645 to run a (mostly) OpenBSD only, self-hosted AS "the old way". Most
