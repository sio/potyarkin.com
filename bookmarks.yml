      With a folow up: [The Cargo Cult of TCP_NODELAY](https://withinboredom.info/blog/2023/01/03/the-cargo-cult-of-tcp_nodelay-when-to-use-it/)

      This article notices and explaines an opinionated Golang's default of
      setting TCP_NODELAY on all TCP sockets. It's used to improve throughput
      over datacenter-grade links (Ethernet) but may result in poor performance
      on unreliable networks (WiFi, mobile). Userspace IO buffering may help to
      work around this problem because raw socket is not easily exposed in
      Golang (to revert this setting in case it's required).

      a shame that GitHub repo is just a ZIP dump.

      *Note*: RDP is not a pixel perfect protocol, it modifies color values in
      a way not perceptible for humans. This makes theoretical density of 24 bits
      per pixel impossible. Article author had settled for mere 3 bits per
      pixel (with a large safety margin). Author estimates that 15 bits per
      pixel should be achievable on a good connection

      "Idle chitchat" vs "smalltalk"

    description: |-
      It took me probably 7 years after moving out of my parent’s place to
      learn that “smalltalk” and “idle chitchat” are not necessarily the same
      thing [...]

      In my taxonomy, “idle chitchat” is talking about things. “Smalltalk” is
      learning about each other. “The weather sure is nice today, isn’t it?” =>
      idle chitchat. You’re not likely to understand a person from that
      starting point, except that “wow look, we both like the sun”. “Where are
      you from? What brings you here?” => smalltalk. You’re encouraging the
      person to reveal some small amounts of information about themselves which
      you can use to probe further and hopefully find something fascinating [...]

      Now I take conversations with strangers (or anyone really) as a sport, as
      a challenge. “How can I use these precious moments we strangers share to
      discover something new? To leave one of us pondering something novel
      later in the evening” [...]

      However, up until then, we live in a burning world, i.e., one evaporating

    description: |-
      A writeup on possible performance bottlenecks with modern computing:

        - Automated environment detection
        - New process overhead
        - Closing file handles on Windows
        - Writing to Terminals
        - Thermal throttling / ACPI C-state, P-state
        - Interpreter overhead
        - Storage I/O
        - Unnecessary compression (zlib vs zstandard vs no compression)
        - Old baseline for x86_64 binaries
        - Inefficiend diff implementations (sometimes lower algorithm complexity
          does not result in faster runtimes)
